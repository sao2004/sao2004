# 👋 Hi, I'm [Your Name]!

🎓 I'm a curious and passionate developer who enjoys building smart, efficient, and sometimes quirky things—whether it's sorting algorithms, garden management apps, or EMF detectors!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: C, C++, Java, Python
- **Technologies & Tools**:
  - Embedded Systems: ESP32, OLED displays, buzzers, sensors
  - GUI Development: JavaFX, Scene Builder
  - Database: SQL, DataGrip
  - Version Control: Git, GitHub

## 🚧 Projects

- 📡 **EMF Detector (ESP32)**  
  Detects electromagnetic fields and shows data on an OLED screen with sound/LED alerts for frequency levels.

- 🌻 **Garden Store Management App (JavaFX)**  
  Manage plant inventory with types like Tulips, Roses, and Daisies. Includes purchase flow, cost logic, and inventory tracking.

- 🧠 **Algorithm Playground**  
  Experimenting with recursive insertion sort, Quicksort hybrids, binary search optimizations, and heap sort implementations.

- ♟ **Java Chess Game**  
  Displays Unicode pieces and checks if a move is valid based on piece-specific movement logic (e.g., Rook, Knight, Bishop).

## 🧪 Interests

- Algorithm design and optimization  
- Game development (possibly a Chip-8 emulator!)  
- GUI-driven applications  
- Embedded programming & interfacing sensors  
- Data structures and system design

## 🔍 Currently Exploring

- Hybrid sorting algorithm thresholds  
- Recursive implementations of classic algorithms  
- Task management GUIs with nested subtasks in Java  
- Hash table performance tuning with open addressing
